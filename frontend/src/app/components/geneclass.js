        1. G Protein-Coupled Receptors (GPCRs)
        </div>
        <div className="collapse-content">
          <p>GPCRs are a large family of cell surface receptors involved in signal transduction. They play crucial roles in sensing external stimuli such as hormones, neurotransmitters, and sensory signals, and they regulate various physiological processes including neurotransmission, hormone secretion, and sensory perception.
